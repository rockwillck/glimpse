# Glimpse
A better search engine for livestreams
## Why
Livestreaming is wildly popular. But on even the most popular sites - like Twitch, the Amazon-owned service - searching is a chore. Glimpse fixes that.
Glimpse draws from *both* Youtube Live and Twitch, giving you access to a unified streaming portal.
Glimpse also employs its own search engine for Twitch, letting you find content **without** digging through tags, categories, and completely unrelated streams.
### FAQ
- My search page is empty!  
*Because Glimpse has to scrape Twitch and Youtube to find you content independently of those services' search algorithms, it may sometimes fall prey to temporary CORS blocks.*
*If that didn't make sense to you, just know that either switching to a different browser, turning on Incognito mode, or refreshing a few times should fix the issue.*
- Is Glimpse free?  
*Glimpse is 100% free (and open source!). This is possible because we have <u>no</u> servers. Everything runs locally, on your computer. That also means no data mining and no privacy concerns.*
- Is Glimpse a livestreaming service?  
*No. Glimpse is basically a search engine for live streams. It only searches Twitch and Youtube - you can't stream on Glimpse itself.*
